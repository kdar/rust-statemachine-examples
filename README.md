> Examples of different ways to represent a state machine in rust

Sometimes you end up needing a state machine, and try to model one in rust and fight with its lifetimes and ownership model. These are some examples you can copy and paste in your own projects (choose which one you like!).

## Installation

### Requirements

* Rust (tested on rustc 1.25.0-nightly (0c6091fbd 2018-02-04))

Just copy the code from one of the src/sm\*.rs files.
